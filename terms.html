<h1>
    By agreeing to these Terms and Conditions—which you definitely didn’t read and we absolutely didn’t expect you to—you consent to everything, including but not limited to: spontaneous dance-offs, unsolicited dad jokes, and the occasional email written entirely in interpretive emoji. Reading the whole thing is optional, but pretending you did is mandatory. By continuing, you waive your right to complain about anything you didn’t read, didn’t understand, or skimmed while half-watching Netflix. Congratulations, you're now legally bound by whatever we just said (or didn't).
</h1>
